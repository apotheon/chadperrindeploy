<h1 class="title">I am a bassist.</h1>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2022-02-17</strong></p>

<div class="content">
  <p>I have been playing at bass for years.  Note I did not say &quot;playing bass&quot;.  That implies a level of seriousness beyond my actual investment in the activity.  I have mostly just been playing <em>at</em> it.</p>
<h4 id="early-basses">Early Basses</h4>
<p>My first electric bass guitar was a junker with a warped neck from a pawn shop; I do not even recall what brand, and do not recall its looks well enough to hazard a guess.  I had no idea what I was doing, and I did not do it long.  Fast-forward a couple years: I had moved across the countinent, and I found myself hankering to pick up a bass again, so I shopped around, mostly at places like Guitar Center.  I put some money down to reserve a bass, then found myself moving more than a thousand miles away again, to a place where there were no local stores of the chain where I had reserved the bass (no, not Guitar Center -- those things are everywhere, the McDonald's of guitar shops), so I called up corporate and got the refundable portion of my money back.  A couple more years later, I found myself spending a lot of time in guitar shops in the area (one of them a Guitar Center).</p>

<h4 id="ibanez-soundgear-extreme-srx590">Ibanez Soundgear Extreme SRX590</h4>
<p>I eventually ended up buying an Ibanez &quot;Soundgear Extreme&quot; SRX590 in a locally owned and operated place called <a href="http://www.spotlightmusicstore.com/">Spotlight Music</a>.  What I got this time was a four string Ibanez Soundgear with two big active humbucker pickups, a beautiful dark finish with a kinda pearlescent silvery edging, and furniture that has a sort of hematite look to it (what a lot of product vendors call &quot;black chrome&quot;).  The styling is beautiful (and a trifle wicked looking), its neck feels smooth and easy to play, the heft is solid but not unwieldy, and the ergonomics are pleasant in general.  It sounds great and feels great, making it easy to understand why Soundgear seems to have a good reputation with session musicians.</p>
<p>I went back to Spotlight for lessons from one of the freelance instructors who used their practice rooms, and ended up with Tony Deyo giving me some much-needed &quot;bassics&quot;.  Either I learned very quickly or he says that to all his students, but in either case I found the experience helpful and the price reasonable.  Unfortunately, life throws curveballs, and continuing regular lessons stopped being practical.</p>
<p>The missus and I eventually decided to get a Playstation (I'm terrible at recalling Playstation numbers, so don't ask) and a copy of Rocksmith 2014.  If you're not familiar with it, Rocksmith 2014 is kinda like Guitar Hero but with <em>real instruments</em>.  You can use either an electric guitar or an electric bass to play this game, and that's just kind of awesome.  This became one of my favorite video games.  (Another favorite game is C programming.  You might notice a tendency to prefer &quot;games&quot; with a practical aspect.  The same goes for sports as for video games.)</p>
<p>I somehow ended up feeling, eventually, like getting a game system running to play bass is just too much work, so I stopped playing Rocksmith for a long time.  I got a headphone amp for practicing with headphones, both because I wanted to be able to practice without broadcasting it at all while still being able to hear it and because it's less work than using a standard bass practice amp.  Eventually, though, I found the practice amp to be kind of annoying sometimes.</p>

<h4 id="dean-electric-acoustic-bass-with-cutout">Dean Electric-Acoustic Bass with Cutout</h4>
<p>Eventually, I developed an interest in getting an acoustic bass guitar.  That interest intensified after my paternal grandfather's memorial service, when I spent some time with a number of relatives I had not seen in quite a while -- three generations of them.  My aunt talked about my grandfather's love of music and passed out some banjo-shaped ukuleles as gifts to everyone in the youngest generation.  My uncle (her brother) brought in his guitar and a fair bit of music ensued.  When I returned home, I started hunting for the most inexpensive acoustic bass guitar I could find that wouldn't just be junk.  I ended up going to <a href="https://www.musicgoround.com">Music Go Round</a> to pick up a used Dean, model AX-EABC-MAH-GC.  That's the Guitar Center model of Dean's standard entry-level electric-acoustic four-string with a cutout (and the less common mahogany finish).  Putting that all together:</p>
<p>I got a Dean Axcess Electric-Acoustic Bass with Cutout, Mahogany Finish, Guitar Center Model.  Yes, that's the long-form name of the bass.</p>
<p>It has a crack in the sealing over the wood finish, but is effectively undamaged, and everything is in pretty good condition otherwise.  It's not quite as easy a neck to play as on the SRX590, but it's still comfortable.  It sounds decent (if not exactly loud) without an amplifier, which means I can practice without having to screw around with electricity and cords.  In that respect, it's exactly what I wanted, and it's what I got.</p>
<p>With all that, I still only really played <em>at</em> bass, after all this time.  For twenty years, I had become an advanced beginner, maybe.  Finally, I decided it was time to try to get a little more serious.  I paid real money for access to a home instruction video series, because I had actually found someone who offered one where the teacher is <em>very obviously</em> good at making bass learning interesting and fun, because of his videos on YouTube.  I generally deplore YouTube for various reasons, but I still find myself using it just because sometimes that is the only place to get something I want, and it led me to Josh Fossgreen and his Bass Buzz instructional series.  So far, the only thing that comes to mind for me as something I would change, it would be to make it [copyfree][copyfree] licensed, because that's something I want for basically everything.</p>
<p><a href="/img/sr375.jpg"><img src="/img/sr375_embed.jpg" style="border: thin solid black" /></a></p>
<h4 id="ibanez-soundgar-sr375">Ibanez Soundgar SR375</h4>
<p>About a third of the way into trying to get through the entire video series in thirty days, two things happened roughly simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I got COVID, which heaved a giant boulder into the placid waters of my peaceful little pool of bass learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A friend of mine, and fellow bassist, gave me a free bass guitar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I say &quot;roughly simultaneously&quot;, I mean: The missus and I met him for dinner.  While there, he asked me if I wanted a five-string bass, and told me he would give me one for free.  That place, where we met for dinner, is where <em>all three of us</em> caught COVID.  Providence giveth, and it taketh away -- or maybe, when providence giveth, it just giveth good and hard, without mercy.</p>
<p>This newest (to me) bass is another Soundgear.  In particular, it is an Ibanez Soundgear SR375, with a fairly typical Ibanez body style, finished in what I think they call &quot;aged whiskey sunburst&quot; on a hefty maple body.  Its five-piece neck is maple and rosewood, and it has a rosewood fingerboard.  It has the ever-attractive Ibaneze &quot;black chrome&quot; tuning machines on the headstock, and a serviceable bridge, plus two black CAP pickups (they look like EXF-N2 humbucker pickups to me).  Like the SRX590, this is an active bass with EQ.  As a friend said when I shared a photo (after carefully removing a silly sticker from it), the SR375 is a &quot;strong&quot; looking bass. I quite like the feel of it; something about fretting on it feels like very heavy butter, in a good way, smooth and substantial; I'm not sure how else to describe it.</p>
<p>It also came with a strap, and strap locks attached to the body that do not in any way, shape, or form look like they were stock, and are so solidly good at keeping the strap in place that I haven't yet figured out how to remove it.  I haven't put any real effort into figuring it out, though.  The strap itself is not exactly to my taste, so I'll probably get a replacement soonish, but it's nice to have those strap locks for whatever strap I eventually get.</p>
<p>This is my first five-string bass.  The closest I had come to getting one was a few years ago when I saw a really nice five-string fretless bass at Music-Go-Round and thought I would like to get it, but I held off to think about it for a few days.  Before I was done thinking, the friend who later gave me the SR375 showed me a bass he picked up at Music-Go-Round, and it was <em>the same bass</em>.  He still has it, and it's his favorite five-string -- maybe his favorite bass all around.  I was not ready for a fretless bass at the time, though, nor was I really ready for a five-string yet.</p>
<p>While going through the Bass Buzz series I started to realize I was ready to get a five-string bass soon, then one magically fell into my lap (along with a nice load of COVID).  It's funny how that works sometimes.</p>
